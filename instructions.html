            <h2>Welcome to the Puzzle Hunt!</h2>
            <p>Your mission is to get to WiCS HQ.</p>
            <p>In order to complete your mission, you must retrieve five passwords total. Solving one puzzle will give you the password to unlock the next level.</p>
            <p>Each puzzle has a time limit of 40 minutes. After the time limit has passed, we request that you move to the next level. While solving a puzzle gives you a set amount of points, the quicker you solve a puzzle, the more points you get.</p>
            <p>Clicking on a planet will take you to a Google Form where you will enter your password. If the password is correct, you will now be able to read and solve the puzzle after returning to the page. Otherwise, you can try again.</p>
            <p>Here's the order in which you'll go:<br>Earth<br>Jupiter<br> Saturn<br> Neptune<br>Venus (aka WiCS HQ)</p>
            <h3>~*~ waste of fuel but it's a cute order so ~*~</h3>
            <p>Call an officer over if you have any questions using the “Ask For Help” button in your Zoom breakout room, or post a question in your designated Slack channel. Don’t be afraid to ask for help!</p>

            <h2> Best of luck on your mission! </h2>
