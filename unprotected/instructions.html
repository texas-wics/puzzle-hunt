            <h2>Welcome to the Puzzle Hunt!</h2>
            <p>Your mission is to get to WiCS HQ.</p>
            <p>In order to complete your mission, you must retrieve five passwords total. Solving one puzzle will give you the password to unlock the next level.</p>
            <p>Each puzzle has a time limit of 40 minutes. After the time limit has passed, we request that you move to the next level. While solving a puzzle gives you a set amount of points, the quicker you solve a puzzle, the more points you get.</p>
            <p>Clicking on a planet will take you to a puzzle. The puzzle will be followed by a google form to submit your solution. All solutions will be in all lowercase characters. Once you have the correct solution and have submitted the google form, you can move onto the next planet! The password is the same as the solution to the previous puzzle.</p>
            <p>Here's the order in which you'll go:
            <br>Earth<br>Mars<br>Jupiter<br>Saturn<br>Uranus<br>Neptune<br>Mercury<br>Venus<br>the Moon - WiCS HQ!
            <h3>~*~ waste of fuel but it's a cute order so ~*~</h3>
            <p>Call an officer over if you have any questions using the “Ask For Help” button in your Zoom breakout room, or post a question in your designated Slack channel. Don’t be afraid to ask for help!</p>

            <h2> Best of luck on your mission! </h2>
            <p></p>
